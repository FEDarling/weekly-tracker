💬 A Q&A with…  
Dr. Axel Rauschmayer  
JavaScript book author and trainer  
_Munich, Germany_

To celebrate the release of his new book, _[JavaScript for Impatient Programmers](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/51522/web)_, we've caught up with once-_JavaScript Weekly_ editor [Dr. Axel Rauschmayer](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/51529/web) to ask him a couple of questions:

What _is_ an 'impatient' programmer?

I’m assuming that readers of my latest book are 'impatient' in the sense that they want to get started with JavaScript as quickly as possible.

Most chapters are split into two parts. First, the basics, or what is the absolute minimum that you need to know? Then, more advanced stuff, or what should you know once you are more familiar with the language?

This is the only book, that I’m aware of, that covers _all_ of JavaScript, up to and including the very latest version (ES2018). That allowed me to omit old features that were superseded by better features in recent versions (but I do include references that explain the omitted features).

What recent JavaScript features do you think are underused and deserve more attention?

Three stand out for me:

*   In the category “boring, but important”, I count modules and classes, because they provide standardization where we previously had competing and incompatible approaches.
*   Built-in support for iteration is great, especially if combined with destructuring: `for (const [i, x] of arr.entries()) console.log(i, x);`
*   Asynchronous functions and asynchronous iteration make asynchronous programming much more pleasant. They are the culmination of a standardization process that started with Promises in ES6.

Dr. Axel Rauschmayer is the author of [JavaScript for Impatient Programmers](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/51522/web) — out now.
